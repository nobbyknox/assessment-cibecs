# TODO

- [x] Create enum for config names. Keep things DRY (and keep from making spelling oopsies).
- [ ] Package solution with custom run script. Don't run through maven.
  - [ ] server
  - [ ] client
- [ ] Fix the spelling mistake of a class name that I saw earlier, but can't recall now.
- [ ] I don't like the wording "tree graph". Make it "filesystem graph" or just "graph".
      Think it over.
- [ ] Tree graph iterator
