# TODO

- [x] Create enum for config names. Keep things DRY (and keep from making spelling oopsies).
- [ ] Package solution with custom run script. Don't run through maven.
  - [ ] server
  - [ ] client
- [ ] I don't like the wording "tree graph". Make it "filesystem graph" or just "graph".
      Think it over.
- [x] Tree graph iterator
- [x] Think about using the source code as file tree instead of the junk I created under
      test resources.
- [ ] Mention in the README.md that my solution is multi-tenanted.
- [ ] Do I actually use the name of a node? If not, get rid of it.
